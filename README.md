# React TodoList + Node.js + MongoDB

This project is a full-stack TodoList application built using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing their todo list.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides efficient state management for the application.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is used for building the backend server and handling API requests.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data. MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing the application's data.

- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building APIs and handling HTTP requests.

- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with MongoDB, making it easier to define schemas, perform database operations, and handle data validation.

- **HTML**: The markup language used for structuring the content of web pages.

- **CSS**: The styling language used for visually styling web pages.

- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to web pages.
